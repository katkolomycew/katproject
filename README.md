Personal Project (Recipe Book) â€” October 2019 (_nology)

After finishing the work on our CVs, we were tasked to work on personal interest projects. I chose a recipe book for mine, with several different personally challenging components such as a filter searchbar, and with the intention to build something useful not just for myself but also for other people.

Although it is not finished and I have since taken up another similar project based more around CSS and have finished that one (it can be seen here on my GitHub under the repo "weekly-mealplans"), I am planning to go back to this project and likely refactor it fully in React.
